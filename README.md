## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)  
- npm or Yarn  
- Database setup (if required)  
- Environment variables ready  

### Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ParthibPal/Doorstep.git
   cd Doorstep
````

2. **Setup Backend**

   ```bash
   cd DoorstepBackend
   npm install
   ```

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment variables (DB\_URI, PORT, etc.).

3. **Setup Frontend**

   ```bash
   cd ../DoorstepFrontend
   npm install
   ```

   Also configure `.env` in frontend: e.g. `VITE_BACKEND_URL`.

4. **Running Locally**

   In two separate terminals:

   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd DoorstepBackend
   npm run dev  # or npm start

   # Frontend
   cd DoorstepFrontend
   npm run dev  # or whatever start command
   ```

   Open browser at `http://localhost:<frontend port>` — frontend will talk to backend via configured URL.

---

## Usage

* Providers fill a multi-step form to register and upload service details.
* Users can browse categories, see services in a modal, add services to cart.
* Cart page shows items, supports removing items; shows total.
* Checkout button posts sales data to backend route, then clears cart.

Screenshots / gifs can be helpful here if you have them.

## API Endpoints

Here are the main backend routes:

| Route                       | Method | Purpose                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/cards`                | GET    | Get all service categories/cards              |
| `/api/cards/:category`      | GET    | Get all services under a given category       |
| `/api/cart?email=<email>`   | GET    | Get cart items for a user                     |
| `/api/cart/:id`             | DELETE | Remove an item from cart                      |
| `/api/sellerTempForm`       | POST   | Step 1 of provider signup (contact info etc.) |
| `/api/sellerTempForm/step2` | POST   | Step 2: password & profile                    |
| `/api/sellerTempForm/step3` | POST   | Step 3: service details, image upload etc.    |
| `/api/sales-table`          | POST   | Save sales data (checkout)                    |

*(Adjust / add more if there are more endpoints or variations.)*

## Environment Variables

Make sure you define (frontend + backend) something similar to:

**Backend `.env`**

```
PORT=5000
DB_URI=your_database_connection_string
# Any other secrets (JWT_SECRET, etc.)
```

**Frontend `.env`** (for Vite)

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
```

---

## Deployment

* Deploy backend on a hosting service (Render, Heroku, AWS, etc.).
* Ensure environmental variables are set in hosting.
* For frontend (especially Vite / React), build and deploy to static host or same host as backend if serving static.
* Make sure CORS is configured if frontend and backend are on different domains.

If you like, I can generate a ready-to-copy version with project-specific details (screenshots, exact database, etc.) so you just paste it in. Do you want me to prepare that?
